                        It consists of 108 verses which are divided into six chapters: Bala-kanda, Ayodhya-kanda, Aranya-kanda, Kishkindha-kanda, Sundara-kanda and Yuddha-kanda.<br>
                        
                        Apart from condensing the story, it helps the devotees to meditate on the different sterling aspects of Lord Rama.</p>
